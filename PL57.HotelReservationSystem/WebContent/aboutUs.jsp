			<h1>About Us</h1>
				<div> <p class="text">The Royal stags is owned and managed by Hotel RoyalVenture Limited which was established in 1997 in Mumbai. The company is part of The Royals Group whose portfolio includes luxury hotel and resort properties, 
				IT and business parks, as well as real estate development.
						Spearheading the group is chairman, Mr.Stalin D'sa, whose vision has been inspired by his strong 
						belief in India’s ability to compete with the world’s premier travel destinations. Mr.Stalin D'sa 
						has led a fulfilling life of hard work and dedication. From starting the first Students’ Union while
						 at school and later taking the reins of his father-in-law’s handloom business - only to grow it 
						 into the country’s largest garment exporting house - D'sa is a singular leader who has worked hard, 
						 relentlessly, towards a focused goal.</p>
						 <p class="text">
						His many business trips to Europe and America exposed him to hotels with high service standards,
						 inspiring him to enter the world of luxury hospitality. At the age of 65, he started to build
						  The Royal Stags Palaces, Hotels and Resorts which today has evolved into one of the most 
						  celebrated indigenous hospitality groups in the luxury segment.
						The Royal Stags Palaces, Hotels and Resorts comprise a collection of luxury hotels and resorts
						 in New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Gurgaon, Udaipur, Goa and Kovalam. New hotel will soon open 
						 in Chennai with plans to develop hotels in Agra, Lake Ashtamudi (Kerala) and Jaipur. 
						 The group has marketing alliances with Germany-based Kempinski, US-based Preferred Hotel 
						 & Resorts and is a member of the Global Hotel Alliance based in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
						 <p class="text">
						Since its founding, The Royal Stags has been at the forefront of bringing alive the drama
						 and grandeur, one that goes far beyond the grand facades and theatrical interior design. T
						 he group is dedicated to extending warm, gracious, anticipatory service in settings that 
						 ideally capture the essence of India. The authentic Indian experience found across the
						  hotels and resorts exemplifies the group’s underlying philosophy to delight and exceed 
						  guest expectations through gracious Indian hospitality, known in the ancient Indian 
						  scriptures as 'Atithi Devo Bhava' which means 'Guest is God.'</p>
